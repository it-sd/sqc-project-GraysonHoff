I made this project throughout the course of my software quality control class.

## Things that went poorly
One big thing that went poorly was getting the database aspect to work. That part was very confusing and almost wasn't taught.

## Things that went good
I got the render link to work. That's great because now I have a working link you can click on.
Here it is: https://chess-games.onrender.com

Overall this project was really annoying because we were just thrown in and weren't taught how to do some of the things we needed to know. Sort of a here's a thing now do it like you've been doing it the entire time thing. Although I am happy with the end results.
